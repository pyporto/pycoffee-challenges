# PyCoffee Challenges

## Event format

The event is suitable for any groups from two to about twenty participants.

Every event is preceded with homework guidelines, which help participants to be better prepared for the upcoming challenge, and to spend less time on grunt work, and more on its creative part.

We start the event by brainstorming the problem with a whiteboard (30-45 minutes). During this stage it's important to outline following aspects of the challenge:

- Explaining problem
- Decomposition into smaller problems (probably by writing some pseudo code)
- Outlining corner cases and variations of the problem

Then we divide ourselves into groups of two to three participants randomly, and spend the rest of the time (about one hour) of coding.

We finish the event by sharing our progress and what we learned along the way.

## How to suggest your own challenge

- If you have write access to the repo, and a clear idea of the challenge, go ahead, and write it down in a new file, and then link to this file from the README.
- If you have a clear idea, but don't have write access to the repo, fork the repo and create a new PR.
- If you don't have an idea, but not sure if it's good or not, or would like to discuss some details before writing it down, [create a new issue](https://github.com/pyporto/pycoffee-challenges/issues/new).
